# sentiment_analysis_deployment

# Introduction
	Sentiment analysis, also refers as opinion mining is a sub machine learning task where the general sentiment of a given document is determined. Using Machine Learning and Natural language processing (NLP) subjective information of a document is extracted and classified according to its polarity (Positive or Negative). It is a useful analysis as it provides an overall opinion of the viewer about a movie. Sentiment analysis is far from to be solved as the language is very complex. This complexity makes it interesting. 
	
	In this project, I choose to try to classify the reviews from IMDB Dataset into ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ sentiment by building a model based on neural networks. IMDB is an online database of information related to films, television etc., Here viewers share their opinion about any movie they watched. It is perfect source of data to determine the current overall opinion about any movie.
